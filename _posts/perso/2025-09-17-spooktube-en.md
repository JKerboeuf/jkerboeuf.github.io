## Description

A small private site for me and my friends that I made to be able to post, interact and review our best videos made on the Content Warning game.  
The site is on the internet but is only accessible by me and my friends to which I manually created logins, in order to have no troubles about confidentiality.  
The site allows users to publish videos, comment, give a note, and favorite videos, it is also possible to search for videos by name or players present on videos.  
It is also possible for the author of a video to modify the information of the video. The comments can also contain a time code, clickable that will blow up the video on the Time Code of the Comment.

## Technical description

The web application is written in **PHP**, and uses a database **MySQL**.  
The style of the site is done thanks to **Bootstrap** as well as **Bootstrap Icons**.  
It also contains a duplicated video check, to avoid uploading the same video several times, even from different users.
