## Description

This is a game about a ball collecting shiny floating things.  
I made this while following the Unity tutorial **["Roll-a-Ball"](https://learn.unity.com/project/roll-a-ball){:target=_blank}**.  
I did extend it a little bit by adding a second level, adding a pickup sound and a small menu when finishing a level.
