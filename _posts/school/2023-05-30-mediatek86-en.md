## Description

A simple Winforms app done as a school work.  
The subject tasked me to make a software for the imaginary media library "Mediatek86" to manage employees and their absences using an SQL database.

## Features

- Use secured connexion to the database to access the software
- Veiw, add, edit and remove employees from the database
- View, add, edit and remove absences from employees
- Comes with an installer
- Comes with full technical documentation

## Technical description

The software was done with **.NET Framework WinForms** in **C#** on the IDE **Visual Studio** in an MVC structure, it operates a **MySQL** database.  
The initial connection is encryted with SHA256 and is SQL injection-proof.

## Context

The Mediatek86 media library needs a tool facilitating the management of its staff that the manager will use.
Mediatek86 requests software allowing the personnel manager to easily manage the staff.
The software allows you to list the staff and their absences, it also allows you to add, modify or delete staff or absence.
