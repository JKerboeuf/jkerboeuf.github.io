## Description

Showcase site for the Ophthalmology office B2.Oeil in Brumath that I did during an internship.

## Technical description

It is done with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) in **html**, **CSS** and **JavaScript** but also **Markdown** for the contents of the pages.
This site also uses the CSS framework [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) and icons from [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/) and [flag-icons](https://flagicons.lipis.dev/).
Being the site of an ophthalmologist's office, the main objective is to be accessible for everyone, for this, the site was made following the rules and recommendations **WCAG** ([Web content accessibility guidelines](https://www.w3.org/tr/wcag22/)). Finally, it complies with the **WCAG 2.2 AAA level** guidelines, thus guaranteeing maximum accessibility for all users.
