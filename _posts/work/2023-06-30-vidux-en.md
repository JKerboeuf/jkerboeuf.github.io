## Description

I did my first year internship for the CNED at [Vidux](https://vidux.net/), a Hungarian company that provides security cameras services.  
I was tasked to renew an internal website for their employees to store their testing and equipment data.

## Technical description

This web app is written in **php** using an MVC design (Model/View/Controller) and operates a **MariaDB** database.  
The users can have different roles, that gives different privileges and access rights to certain pages and functions (such as Admins can manage users).  
A localization system was made so the app could be understood by all users that would use it (English, Hungarian & French)  
It uses Bootstrap for styling and Font Awesome for icons.

## Context

Vidux, a Hungarian company operating mainly in Europe but especially in surrounding countries, offers its installation, maintenance and support services in video surveillance, often to banks.
I was responsible for modernizing an internal web application for inventorying equipment tests.
