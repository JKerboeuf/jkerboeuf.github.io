It is this website ! It is my tool to give updates and publish my works to the world.  
It is made with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and freely hosted on [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/).  
I took the [WhatATheme](https://thedevslot.github.io/WhatATheme/) template by [The Devslot](https://github.com/thedevslot) as a base, but I intend to change a lot of things to get it to how **I** really want my website to be.  
The website also uses [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) and [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/).
