## What is it ?

I am a huge fan of Pokemon and I always wanted to do a game similar to the Pokemon games, and this very early project is my take on it.  
It is not meant to be *very* similar to Pokemon, it looks like this for now because I am no artist and just needed some assets to see how would the game play.  
I intend to continue working on this project in the future, but I am more focused on other things for now.

## DISCLAIMER

Because I obviously do not own any of Pokemon's assets, **I will never share** this project until it is fully filled with original assets from me.  
It is for my personal use only for now.

### What does my game currently have ?

- Real-time fighting
- "*Energy*" to use attacks
- Staged music depending on the fight's state
- Randomized team and attacks picked from a pool

### What is planned ?

Note that this project is still in a very early state, nothing is final

- Interesting story, side-stories, and secondary characters stories
- A banching skill tree to allow different playstyles
- Randomized attributes for the *"monsters"* to allow perfectionists and try-harders to farm for the best of the best (similar to Borderlands' weapons)
- Randomized attacks gained based on the *"monster"* attributes (does it have sharp claws ? Maybe he will get devastating cutting attacks then)
- Third-person 3D point of view in an *"open"* world with accurately scaled structures and monsters

## How does it look ?
