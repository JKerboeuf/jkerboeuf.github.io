## What is it ?

I did my first year internship for the CNED at [Vidux](https://vidux.net/), a Hungarian company that provides security cameras services.  
I was tasked to renew an internal website for their employees to store their testing and equipment data.  
As it is a private work for Vidux, I am not allowed to share the source code, but can show some screenshots.

## How does it look ?
