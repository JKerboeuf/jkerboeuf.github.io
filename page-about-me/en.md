## Likes & Hobbies

I am passionate about video games but I also love pretty much anything related to computers and programming.  
I am interested in the esport scene as well, but I mostly care about League of Legends esport.  
I listen to music almost all of the time, often listening to bass music, but I can enjoy pretty much anything.  
I like to read mangas and watch animes, I also practised archery and would love to get back into it when I find myself some spare time.
