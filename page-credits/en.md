## Content

All of the content written on this website is made by myself, **Julien Kerboeuf**, as its author and creator.

## Hosting

The website is hosted by [**Github**](https://github.com/){:target="_blank"} using their [**Github Pages**](https://pages.github.com/){:target="_blank"} service and is built by [**Jekyll**](https://jekyllrb.com/){:target="_blank"}

## Code

The website is written in a mix of **Markdown** for the page's contents, **HTML** and **Liquid** for the layouts, **SCSS** for the style, a little bit of **JavaScript**.  
You can view its source code by clicking on this link :  [**Source Code**](https://github.com/JKerboeuf/jkerboeuf.github.io){:target="_blank"}

## Style

[**Bootstrap 5**](https://getbootstrap.com/){:target="_blank"} is used as a base for the styling, mostly for its grid system and all of its very helpful utilities.  
I also use [**Font Awesome**](https://fontawesome.com/){:target="_blank"} and [**flag-icons**](https://flagicons.lipis.dev/){:target="_blank"} for the icons.

## Localization

The localization system was made following [**Mc Pride's**](https://github.com/mcpride){:target="_blank"} awesome [**guide to make localized jekyll pages**](https://mcpride.github.io/posts/development/2018/02/25/localized-jekyll-pages-without-plugin/){:target="_blank"}.
